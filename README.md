## E-Assignments

A collection of online exercises is available at https://e-assignments.net. 

## Grading

Grading will be based to 100% on project work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your project work will only be graded if you have successfully completed **at least 50% of the e-Assignments**.

## Bonus

A bonus of up to **1.0 point on the final course grade** can be obtained by meaningful contribution to the course materials. 

## Module description

In this module, students will acquire the necessary programming skills for data analysis and scientific computing. The module covers essential topics
such as data structures, control structures, functions, loops, recursion, object-oriented programming, comments, exception handling, and
algorithms. Through project work, students will gain practical experience with a programming language commonly used in data science, enabling them to efficiently manipulate and process large datasets. They will learn to write well-structured code and develop problem-solving skills that are essential for implementing
algorithms and analyzing data. By mastering scientific programming, students will become proficient in translating business problems into
computational solutions, enhancing their ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets.

### Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:

- develop code for processing and analyzing data
- develop algorithms for manipulating data
